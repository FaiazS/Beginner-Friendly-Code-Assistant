            "2.  **Thread Creation:** We create two threads to sort each half of the array recursively. This allows us to sort both halves simultaneously, which can significantly improve performance for large arrays.\n",
            "3.  **Synchronization:** We use the `join()` method to wait for each thread to finish sorting its half of the array. This ensures that the threads finish sorting their respective halves before we merge the results.\n",
            "4.  **Merging:** We use a temporary array to merge the sorted left and right halves. This allows us to compare elements from both halves and merge them into the original array in sorted order.\n",
            "5.  **Thread Safety:** Since we're working with an array and using `System.arraycopy()` to copy elements, we don't need to worry about thread safety issues related to shared data. However, if we were using a more complex data structure or sharing objects between threads, we would need to ensure thread safety using synchronization mechanisms like locks or atomic variables.\n",

            "*   **Complexity:** Implementing multi-threaded mergesort is more complex than the single-threaded version, as it requires creating and managing threads, synchronizing access to shared data, and handling thread-related issues like deadlocks or starvation.\n",
            "*   **Scalability:** Multi-threaded mergesort can scale well for large arrays, but it may not be the best choice for very large datasets that don't fit into memory. In such cases, external sorting algorithms like external mergesort may be more suitable.\n",
