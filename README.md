# 🤖 AI Code Assistant (Beginner-Friendly LLM Coding Assistant)

Welcome to **AI Code Assistant** – a simple but powerful project that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to help developers (especially beginners) generate, document, and explain code step by step using natural language instructions.

This project showcases **AI-powered coding helper** using Python, Groq LLMs (like LLaMA 3 70B), and `LiteLLM`.
